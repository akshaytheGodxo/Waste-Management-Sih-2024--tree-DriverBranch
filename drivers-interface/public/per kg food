To estimate the cost of mixed food waste, use an average cost per kilogram based on typical food prices. Here’s a rough breakdown for common categories:

    Rice: ₹50 per kg
    Vegetables (e.g., potatoes): ₹30 per kg
    Fruit (e.g., apples): ₹100 per kg
    Meat (e.g., chicken): ₹200 per kg

Calculate the Weighted Average Cost:

If you don’t have detailed breakdowns for the mixed waste, estimate the average cost using a weighted approach. For simplicity, you can assume a rough mix:

    50% Vegetables
    30% Rice
    10% Fruit
    10% Meat

Calculate the average cost as follows:
Average Cost=(0.5×₹30)+(0.3×₹50)+(0.1×₹100)+(0.1×₹200)
Average Cost=(0.5×₹30)+(0.3×₹50)+(0.1×₹100)+(0.1×₹200)
Average Cost=₹15+₹15+₹10+₹20=₹60 per kg
Average Cost=₹15+₹15+₹10+₹20=₹60 per kg
2. Estimate Cost for Mixed Waste

Suppose you have 10 kg of mixed food waste:
Total Estimated Cost=10 kg×₹60/kg=₹600
Total Estimated Cost=10 kg×₹60/kg=₹600
